# Linking MCP-router to GitHub Repository

## Git Remote Setup Commands

```bash
# Navigate to the MCP-router directory
cd /Users/kevinbrown/MCP-router

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Initial commit
git commit -m "Initial MCP-router project structure

- Smart routing and workflow orchestration foundation
- Complete shared memory library (mcp-shared-memory)
- Panic detection and workflow enforcement architecture  
- Cross-domain memory coordination system
- Comprehensive documentation and development roadmap
- Universal memory components for all MCP servers"

# Add the GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/kevin-biot/MCP-router.git

# Set the default branch name to main
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Verify Remote Connection

```bash
# Check that remote is configured correctly
git remote -v

# Should show:
# origin  https://github.com/kevin-biot/MCP-router.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/kevin-biot/MCP-router.git (push)
```

## Current Repository Contents

### âœ… **Shared Memory Library** (Crown Jewel)
- `/src/memory/shared-memory.ts` - Complete implementation
- `/src/memory/package.json` - Standalone npm package
- `/src/memory/README.md` - Detailed usage documentation
- `/src/memory/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

### âœ… **Directory Structure**
- Complete routing, workflow, backends, auth, monitoring directories
- Comprehensive test structure (unit, integration, fixtures)
- Documentation framework (architecture, API, workflows, deployment)
- Configuration management

### âœ… **Documentation**
- Comprehensive README with architecture vision
- Smart routing intelligence explanation
- Workflow engine and panic detection details
- Memory library usage examples
- Development roadmap and integration guides

## Repository Highlights

ðŸ§  **Smart Orchestration:** Context-aware tool routing and workflow enforcement  
ðŸ§© **Universal Memory:** Shared library used by all MCP servers  
ðŸš¨ **Panic Prevention:** Detects and prevents destructive operational patterns  
ðŸ”„ **Workflow Engine:** Structured diagnostic processes  
ðŸ“Š **Cross-Domain Learning:** Knowledge transfer between different operational domains  

## Future Development Workflow

```bash
# Create feature branch for memory enhancements
git checkout -b feature/enhanced-memory-search

# Make changes, commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add cross-domain similarity search"

# Push feature branch  
git push -u origin feature/enhanced-memory-search

# After testing, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/enhanced-memory-search
git push origin main

# Delete feature branch
git branch -d feature/enhanced-memory-search
git push origin --delete feature/enhanced-memory-search
```

## GitHub Repository Benefits

âœ… **Shared Memory Distribution:** Other projects can reference the memory library  
âœ… **Collaboration:** Router development and memory enhancements  
âœ… **Documentation:** Architecture decisions and API guides visible  
âœ… **Issue Tracking:** Feature requests and bug reports  
âœ… **Release Management:** Version tagging for memory library releases  
âœ… **Integration Examples:** How other MCP servers use the router  

## Post-Setup Actions

1. **Verify README renders** properly on GitHub
2. **Set up Issues** for router development milestones  
3. **Configure branch protection** for main branch
4. **Create releases** for shared memory library versions
5. **Set up GitHub Actions** for automated testing (future)

## Commands Summary

```bash
cd /Users/kevinbrown/MCP-router
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Smart routing + shared memory foundation"
git remote add origin https://github.com/kevin-biot/MCP-router.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup

1. **MCP-ocs can reference** the shared memory library via GitHub
2. **Documentation hosting** on GitHub Pages (optional)
3. **Collaborative development** of routing intelligence
4. **Memory library versioning** and release management
5. **Integration testing** with multiple MCP servers

Ready to execute these commands and establish the MCP-router GitHub presence!
